    description: "The Porsche Macan Electric represents Porsche's second-generation Macan and the brand's first fully electric compact luxury SUV, launched in 2024 as a complete redesign built on the Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture co-developed with Audi. Production began in May 2024 at the Leipzig plant alongside the older internal combustion engine version. The electric Macan is offered in multiple variants: Macan Electric (single rear motor, RWD), Macan 4 Electric (dual motors, AWD), Macan 4S Electric, and Macan Turbo Electric. Performance ranges from 5.7 seconds for the base single-motor variant to 3.3 seconds for the Turbo Electric. The vehicle features a 95 kWh lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt (Li-NMC) battery pack with 270 kW DC fast charging capability, allowing 10-80% charge in approximately 22 minutes. The interior showcases Porsche's latest digital cockpit with three screens: a curved 12.6-inch instrument cluster, a 10.9-inch central infotainment system, and an optional 10.9-inch screen for the front passenger. The Macan Electric shares its PPE platform with the Audi Q6 e-tron, maintaining Porsche's signature driving dynamics while offering zero-emission mobility with an estimated range of up to 381 miles (WLTP) depending on the variant."
